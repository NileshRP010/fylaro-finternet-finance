2. You should see the Fylaro landing page with a "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right navbar
3. Click the "ðŸ”§ Wallet Debug" button in the bottom-right to open debug information (only visible in development)
4. Click "Connect Wallet" button in the navbar
5. A modal should open showing available wallet options
6. Click on "MetaMask" (should show with a ðŸ¦Š icon and "Recommended" badge)
7. MetaMask should prompt you to connect your wallet
