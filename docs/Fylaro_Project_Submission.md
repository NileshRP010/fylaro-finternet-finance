## Technical stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS (shadcn/ui)
- Charts/UI: Recharts, Lucide icons
- Wallets: wagmi, RainbowKit
- Backend: Node.js / Express, WebSocket (socket.io)
- Smart contracts: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js / Viem
- Storage: IPFS (Pinata); Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (back-end models present)
- Testing: Hardhat tests, vitest
- Devops: deploy scripts, Docker suggested

## Architecture overview

- Frontend (React): UI, wallet integration, dashboards, subscribes to WebSocket events.
- Backend (Express): API for invoices, trading, documents, credit scoring; WebSocket server for real‑time events.
- Blockchain layer: smart contracts for tokenization, marketplace, settlement, liquidity and risk; emits events consumed by backend.
- Storage: IPFS for documents; DB for metadata and state; Redis for caching.
- Finternet gateway / Unified Ledger: orchestration layer for cross-border settlement and compliance.

## Smart contract inventory (summary)

- InvoiceToken.sol — tokenizes invoices and manages token lifecycle (mint, verify, mark paid).
- Marketplace.sol — listing, bidding, buying, escrow and fee handling.
- Settlement.sol — automated payment distribution and settlement logic.
- PaymentTracker.sol — tracks on-chain/off-chain payments and triggers settlement.
- LiquidityPool.sol — liquidity for quick settlement and market-making.
- CreditScoring.sol / RiskAssessment.sol — risk & credit scoring used by pricing and marketplace.
- UnifiedLedger/FinternetGateway — orchestration and cross-contract coordination.

## API & WebSocket highlights

- Authentication: POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/login, GET /api/auth/profile
- Invoice management: POST /api/invoices/upload, GET /api/invoices, GET /api/invoices/:id
- Trading: POST /api/trading/orders, GET /api/trading/orderbook/:pair, GET /api/trading/history
- Documents: POST /api/documents/upload (IPFS), GET /api/documents/:id
- Credit scoring: GET /api/credit/score, POST /api/credit/update
- WebSocket events: invoice_status_update, trade_executed, order_book_update, payment_received

## Run & deploy (local development)

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, npm, MongoDB or Docker, Hardhat for contracts.

1. Install

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start backend + frontend (recommended)

```powershell
npm run start:dev
```

3. Or run separately

```powershell
# Backend
cd backend; npm run dev
# Frontend (new shell)
npm run dev
```

4. Compile and test contracts

```powershell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

5. Deploy contracts (example, Arbitrum Sepolia)

```powershell
# Ensure .env set with DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY and ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
npx hardhat deploy --network arbitrumSepolia --tags Fylaro
```

Notes & environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill RPC, DB, Pinata and JWT secrets.
- For IPFS, provide Pinata keys or run a local IPFS node.
- After deployment, update frontend/backend with deployed contract addresses.

## Security & compliance notes

- Role-based access control on contracts (OpenZeppelin roles).
- ReentrancyGuard and input validation in critical contracts.
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive off-chain data, JWT auth, helmet & rate-limiting for API.
- Emergency pause and role-revocation paths included in contracts.

## Submission blurb (short, one paragraph)

Fylaro Finance is a production-ready invoice tokenization and marketplace platform that enables businesses to convert invoices into blockchain-native assets and access global investor liquidity. The system combines IPFS-secured document storage, advanced credit scoring, a decentralized trading marketplace, and automated settlement via Solidity smart contracts. Built with React/TypeScript, Node.js, and Hardhat, Fylaro demonstrates Finternet principles—single identity, cross-border interoperability, and a unified ledger—to lower financing costs and increase liquidity for SMEs worldwide.

## Files to attach with submission

- `README-COMPLETE.md` (full docs)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (architecture details)
- `docs/CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT.md` (deployment steps)
- `contracts/` (smart contract sources)
- `backend/` and `src/` (code)

## Conversion to Word (.docx)

Option A — using Pandoc (if installed):

```powershell
# From repo root
pandoc docs/Fylaro_Project_Submission.md -o docs/Fylaro_Project_Submission.docx
```

Option B — using Microsoft Word:

- Open `docs/Fylaro_Project_Submission.md` in Word (Word can import Markdown) and choose Save As → Word Document (.docx).

## Next steps I can take

- Produce a polished one-page PDF or DOCX directly (I can attempt conversion here if you want me to try).
- Generate a short slide deck (3–5 slides) summarizing the platform.
- Produce a security checklist tailored to contract review.
